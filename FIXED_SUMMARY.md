# ✅ TreeHeal App - Issues Fixed & How to Test

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### Problem 1: SVG Icons Not Working on Web
**Error**: `ReferenceError: Property 'require' doesn't exist`
**Cause**: `react-native-svg` doesn't work on web without extra config
**Solution**: ✅ Replaced all SVG icons with emoji/text icons

**Changed:**
- ❤️ Heart (was SVG)
- 🛡️ Shield (was SVG)
- 📊 Activity (was SVG)
- 👥 Users (was SVG)
- ‹ › ✓ Chevrons & Check (text characters)

These work on **web, Android, and iOS**!

## ⚠️ Why Android Emulator Doesn't Work:

You're missing:
- ❌ Java JDK (required for Android builds)
- ❌ JAVA_HOME environment variable
- ❌ Android SDK properly configured

**To fix Android Studio testing**: See [ANDROID_SETUP.md](ANDROID_SETUP.md) (~30-45 min setup)
